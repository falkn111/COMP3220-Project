# COMP3220-Project

classes created: 
Menu - display all the contents of the open data source
Category - object for different types of information

Project Phases:

You are to assist the City of Windsor in developing the next generation open data access portal, 
complete with the ability to collect data, manage it, distribute it in various formats, and deliver 
high-quality API libraries for developers. Your mission, inspired by what other tools you have seen 
in these case studies, to present to the stakeholders in the City a state of the art tool for open data.

Project Phase 1: INCEPTION - Draw from the City's website any information you need (such as vision, open data plan, etc.) 
to create a document for inception, addressing all 9 inception artifacts. Be creative and realistic in 
the features of the open data management tool that you are going to create. â€‹DUE: October 19, 11:59pm

Project Phase 2: Elaboration iteration 1.

Based on your phase plan in inception, proceed to the first development cycle. 
Here you need to make sure you have employed all the team collaboration tools including:

code repository,
version control,
bug reporting tool and
project management/task tracking for the team (eg. redmine),
testing strategy,
documentation repository.
Explain what the phase plan is, what the tasks are, and the resulting product (coded/working) for this iteration phase.

Much of this phase is done using UML for all architectural designs from use cases, and any object-oriented 
programming language (Java preferably) to create code implementations. DUE November 9, 11:59 pm. 
One submission per group. This is timeboxed, missing all phase plan objectives would have to be explained.

Grading Scheme:  [2 points for each item shown and explained from the above list - total 12 points] and, 
the phase plan 5pts, and the resulting product of this iteration [3pts] = total 20 pts  

Project Phase 3: Elaboration 2/ Final Report.

For most of the items above you can provide in your report a URL link to the hosting location, e.g. link to your 
git, docs, etc. Include a 1 page 

Use LaTex tool (e.g. overleaf) to create and submit your document in PDF format. Maximum 10 pages. 
Be sure to document your prototypes and design sketches clearly explaining your reasoning for it.

The project you are developing with your team must demonstrate some key features in the software development cycle.

In the first phase you created an Inception document (based on the outline discussed regarding the artifacts of i
nception and the use of FURP+ for identifying key requirements of high risk). In the first 2 weeks maximum, 
you made a decision: either you have a working prototype and solid vision and ready to proceed to Elaboration, or 
you identify the high risks that can cause imminent project failure and report them to the instructor, then, in 
that case, you would restart the process to identify revisions.

You should now have answers to these questions:
1) what is the problem you are trying to address in your proposed application? How will it help/assist humans? 
what decisions will the software "make" for us or assist us in doing?
2) what are some of the comparable products in existence today, and how is your application going to be different? 
(what is the added value you are introducing?)
3) what is the architecture, or design platform of your application? discuss this section in more detail in your report.
4) what do you expect to accomplish? (list of deliverables/expectations)
5) briefly justify and place a price/cost savings that your application will benefit its users (economic impact?)

You will be required to submit the following:
- Artifacts of Inception (previously done as part of your first phase submission)
- Elaboration: Phase I report. Include the following: link to a project website, link to gitlab/github repository, 
a link to the software project management used by your team (Redmine/Jira/etc.), and a PDF document outlining your 
progress, including objectives and deliverables with team critique of any drawbacks and issues encountered along 
with any mitigation plans. Don't forget to include test strategies and product documentation drafts.
